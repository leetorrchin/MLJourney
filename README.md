# MLJourney

This will be the githup repo for my journey in ML.

The plan for now is:

Familiarise myself with Python, relearn DSA, and learn how to solve problems 
involving DSA through Python.

Then, we will learn Sequel.

Because we already understand large concepts of ML, we will then start to build 
projects.
